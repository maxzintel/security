# Application Security Principles
**Notes and practice on securing applications.**

We will be recording different types of threats, give examples of how to stage our own mock attacks, and practice defending against XSS, man-in-the-middle, CSFR, Click Jacking, Resource Tampering, HTTPS Downgrade, and 3rd Party Asset Injection attacks.

Initially this repository will consist of basic principles covered in Mike Works web security course. However, the goal will be to expand this to cover topics from textbooks and personal experience as time goes on.
